            Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Sadanand Singh</strong>. I work at{" "}
            <ExtLink link="https://whiterabbit.ai/">Whiterabbit.ai.</ExtLink>{" "}
            I build AI models in medical imaging and enjoy working with Algorithms, Python/C++, and medical and biological data. My background is in computational physics, numerical modeling and optimization and software design. I have a PhD in computational physics/chemical engineering focusing on computational models of nano-materials and bio-molecules.
